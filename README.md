# 👋 Daniel Lankry

Computer Science student at **Holon Institute of Technology (HIT)** 🇮🇱  
Focused on **Cybersecurity**, **Machine Learning**, and **production-level software projects**.

I build things end-to-end: data → logic → evaluation → presentation.  
I care about correctness, structure, and understanding systems deeply.
